third number is tweaks, i.e. bugfixes, code changes etc


v0.1.0  : 26/06/23
    - Basic shop with one turret and sell button
    - Can place and sell turrets
    - Can earn money
    - Can die
    - Track implemented
    - Enemies spawn at the start and follow the Track

v0.2.0
    - Rework of the turret code
    - Added circleTurret, which shoots projectiles in a 360 degree circle, whilst slowly rotating
    - Added artillery turret, which has infinite range and fire slow moving projectiles that explode on impact

v0.2.1
    - Added health and healthbars to enemies
    - added new triangle enemy
        - Has 1hp
        - Moves quickly
        - $1 on kill
    - Square enemy stat changes
        - 1hp => 2hp
        - movement slowed
        - $1 => $2 on kill

        - $3 on kill
    - Added new Hexagon enemy
        - 3hp

    - Current ideas for enemies is that each enemy gets an additional side to their shape, and +1hp and +$1 on kill
    - Maybe cloaked / healing / reinforced enemies?
    - next changes should be to overhaul the enemy spawning script:
        - Display current round
        - Wave budget gets higher and higher each round (already done)
        - can spawn multiple types of enemies (already done)
            - Each enemy can only spawn after a certain round (and have a higher cost)
